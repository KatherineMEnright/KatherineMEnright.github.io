As a Research Assistant at Yale-NUS College in 2023, I created the website <b>[Biodiversity Stories: Cultural Environmental Histories of Introduced Species in Singapore and Southeast Asia](https://www.juncture-digital.org/Digital-Scholarship-NUS-Libraries/biodiversitystories/)</b>. I worked with eight student authors to develop 16 interactive visual essays that showcase the rich histories and contemporary lives of non-native species, using Juncture, a platform developed by JSTOR Labs and Dumbarton Oaks. I edited each essay and the collection as a whole, taught the authors how to use Juncture, and created the website.
